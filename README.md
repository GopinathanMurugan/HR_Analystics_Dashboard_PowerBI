## Project Overview

### Project Goal
The HR Analytics Dashboard project aims to help HR professionals make data-driven decisions on employee retention, development, and recruitment using Power BI.

### Technologies Used
The project leverages Power BI, Advanced Excel, and Statistics for data analysis and visualization.

### Key Metrics
The dashboard focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
- Employee count
- Attrition rate
- Active employees
- Average age

### Visualizations
The dashboard includes visualizations such as:
- Lollipop charts
- Bar charts
- Pie charts

These visualizations track employee attrition based on factors like gender, age, and job satisfaction.

### Outcome
The analysis revealed trends in employee attrition, particularly among salespeople due to salary and growth issues, offering actionable insights for HR to improve retention strategies.

## Data Sources

- **HR Analytics Data**: The dataset used for this analysis is “HR_Analytics.csv” and an Excel file on compensation, containing detailed HR data.

## Tools

The following tools and technologies were used in this project:
- **Power BI**: For creating visualizations, reports, and dashboards.
- **Power Query**: To clean, transform, and load data into Power BI.
- **DAX Query**: For data analysis and creating measures in Power BI.
- **Advanced Excel**: Used for initial data handling and analysis.
- **Statistics**: For analyzing trends and generating insights.

## Data Cleaning

Steps for data cleaning included:
- **Removing Duplicates**: Ensuring no duplicate employee records are present.
- **Renaming Columns**: Standardizing column names for consistency and readability.
- **Changing Data Types**: Converting data types (e.g., text to numbers or dates) to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Filtering Data**: Focusing on specific, relevant data for the analysis.
- **Applying Transformations**: Using Power Query to clean and transform datasets uniformly.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analyses were performed:
- **Understanding Attrition Trends**: Analyzing turnover rates over time, segmented by gender, age, and other factors.
- **Distribution of Employees**: Examining how employees are distributed across departments, age groups, and education levels.
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: Comparing attrition rates between male and female employees.
- **Job Satisfaction Levels**: Investigating the impact of job satisfaction on employee retention.
- **Salary and Promotion Insights**: Identifying patterns related to salary stagnation and promotion frequency in relation to attrition.

## Data Analysis

Key analyses performed:
- **Attrition Rate Calculation**: Calculating the percentage of employees leaving the organization over time.
- **Employee Count and Active Employees**: Analyzing the total number of employees and the number of active employees.
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracking attrition trends over time to identify high-risk periods for employee turnover.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Breaking down attrition rates by gender, age, and education.
- **Salary and Performance Correlation**: Examining the relationship between employee salary levels, job performance, and turnover rates.

## Results

Key findings from the analysis:
- **Increased Attrition in Sales**: Sales teams had higher attrition rates due to low salaries and limited growth opportunities.
- **Key Attrition Factors**: Salary and job satisfaction were identified as the main drivers of employee turnover.
- **Actionable Insights**: HR teams can now use this data to focus on areas like salary adjustments and career growth to improve retention.
- **Improved Retention Strategies**: The dashboard provides HR with the necessary data to make data-driven decisions on employee retention.
- **Better Workforce Management**: HR can now monitor employee distribution and attrition by demographic factors to enhance workforce planning.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made:
1. **Increase Salaries for Salespeople**: Adjust compensation to reduce high attrition rates.
2. **Improve Promotion Opportunities**: Create clear pathways for career growth to retain top talent.
3. **Enhance Job Satisfaction**: Improve workplace conditions and benefits to lower employee attrition.
4. **Targeted Retention Strategies**: Implement strategies focusing on high-risk groups, such as younger employees or sales teams.
5. **Regular Monitoring of Key Metrics**: Continuously track key metrics such as attrition rate, job satisfaction, and salary competitiveness.

## Getting Started

To set up the dashboard:
1. Download the dataset `HR_Analytics.csv` and the compensation Excel file.
2. Import the datasets into Power BI using Power Query.
3. Clean and transform the data as outlined in the Data Cleaning section.
4. Create visualizations and analyses as described in the Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Analysis sections.
